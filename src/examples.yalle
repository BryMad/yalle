Normally in Texas, we're opposed to fencing people in, but when it comes to structs, you gotta corral your variables with enough length of barbed wire ("-x-x-x-") and wall 'em in on the sides ("|"). Sure, maybe it's a tad tedious, but what's wrong with giving a little geography 

FUNCTION

    let a
