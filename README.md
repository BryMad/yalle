# YALL\*E

![](docs/logo.png)

## A LoneStar Codin' Experience

Experts have prophesied that American regional accents will one day be extinct. YALL\*E is a coding language for anyone who (like me) grew up hearing the soothing sounds of a Texas drawl and will miss it when it's gone. It's also for anyone else who wants to bring a bit of wild-west, rootin-tootin' LoneStar spirit to their hoity-toity, city-fied code.

*(editors note to Dr. Toal: wishing I had an idea for a language that had a bit more of a coding function beyond just being language recast. Stretch goal is to add something else that makes it fun or that answers a coding need but currently still hunting for that. Also feeling a bit overwhelmed by the technical side of this class, so starting small for now.)*

*(editors note #2: had a big ole snafu today and realized I had misnamed my project. Had to restart and redo the tutorials for getting node set up, tests, etc. Had to triage where to invest time. The example programs in the README and in the examples folder are what fell by the wayside. Sorry about that! Will get them in soon)*
