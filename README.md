# YALL\*E

### A LoneStar Codin' Experience

Experts have prophesied that American regional dialects will one day be extinct. YALL\*E is a coding language for anyone who (like me) grew up hearin' the soothing sounds of a Texas drawl and will miss it when it's gone. It's also for anyone lookin' to bring a bit of wild-west, rootin-tootin' LoneStar spirit to their hoity-toity, city-fied code.

# Statements

<br>
Yalle is equipped to do all your classic statements. Let's check 'em out...
<br>
<br>

## Variable Assignment

Brand your variable assignments into your computer's innards by declarin' `brand`, tellin' YALLE what `type` of variable we're dealin' with, give it a name, assign it with `=`, then end your statement with a `;`.

```
brand int horseshoes = 10 ;
```

<br>

<br>

## Control Flow

### Iffin Statements

For conditionals, YALLE has `iffin` statements:

```
iffin [condition] ~~{ block ; }"
```

Blocks gets roped in by a swinging rope and a lasso loop `~~{}`

```
~~{ block here ; }
```

<br>

### Otherwise Statements

Iffin an iffin statement proves false and untrustworthy, and you want to follow it with something ELSE to do, use `otherwise`:

```
iffin time == supper ~~{ wrastle beans;}
otherwise ~~{ wrastle herd;}`
```

<br>

### While Statements

"While" sounds good in a Texas drawl, so why fix something that ain't broken.

```
while month < 9
~~{guadalupe_river_toobin = true;}
```

<br>

### Breaks

Break a till statement or any other process with a `whoa`

```
while picnic = true;
    iffin frito_pies < 0 ~~{ whoa ;}
```

<br>

## Return Statements

In YALLE, we don't return things, we `wrastle` 'em up:

```
iffin horsehoes < horses * 4 ~~{wrastle more_horse_shoes()}
```

<br>

## Print Statements

To print in YALLE, just ask it to holler something out:

```
holler "Howdy world!"
```

## Sample Programs

Still working on these. Sorry!
