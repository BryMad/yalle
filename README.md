# YALL\*E

![](docs/logo.png)

## A LoneStar Codin' Experience

Experts have prophesied that American regional accents will one day be extinct. YALL\*E is a coding language for anyone who (like me) grew up hearing the soothing sounds of a Texas drawl and will miss it when it's gone. It's also for anyone else who wants to bring a little wild-west, rootin-tootin' LoneStar spirit to their hoity-toity, city-fied code.

(editors note to Dr. Toal: wishing I had an idea for a language that had a bit more of a coding function beyond just being a goofy word-swap language. Stretch goal is to add something else that makes it fun or answers a coding need, but currently still hunting for that. Also feeling a bit overwhelmed by the technical side of this class, so starting small for now.)

## Example Tasks

### Printing

<table>
<tr> <th>JavaScript</th><th>YALL*E</th>

<tr>
</table>

### Variable Assignment

Lassoes are for variables that yall might want to assign, then reassign. Brands are for constants that will forever be in the same herd.

<table>
<tr> 
<th>
JavaScript</th>
<th>YALL*E</th><tr>
</tr>

```
let horseshoes = 10
```

</td>

const HERD = "Alamo"
```

</td>

```
lasso HERD = "Alamo"
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Sample Programs

### BMI

```
function calculateCompoundInterest(principal, annualRate, timesCompounded, years):
    lasso amount = principal _ (1 + annualRate / timesCompounded(timesCompounded _ years);
    reckon amount
```
